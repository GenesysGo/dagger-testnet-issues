## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. For non-security-related bugs, please submit a new bug report [here](https://github.com/GenesysGo/dagger-testnet-issues/issues). 
2. For security-related reports, please open a **"security vulnerability"** report [here](https://github.com/GenesysGo/dagger-testnet-issues/security/advisories/new).

Please provide a clear and concise description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant screenshots or logs.

**Important:** For security-related issues, please include as much information as possible for reproduction and what its related to. Please be sure to use the report a security vulnerability feature in the repository listed above. If you submit a security vulnerability as a public bug report, we reserve the right to remove the report and move any communications to private channels until a resolution is made.

Security related issues should only be reported through this repository.

While we strongly encourage the use of this repository for bug reports and security issues, you may also reach out to us via our Discord server. However, please note that we will redirect you to submit the bug report through this GitHub repository for proper handling and tracking.
